  <br>D-DAY includes a total of 10 tracks including main track "Haegeum" and pre-release track "People Pt.2 (feat. IU)". The album acts as the finale of the Agust D trilogy after his two previous mixtapes, Agust D (2016)
   and D-2 (2020). The main track "Haegeum" puts its spin on a hip-hop track with Korean traditional string instrument haegeum sound. SUGA participated in the songwriting of all tracks and the overall production of D-DAY, 
   boasting his unparalleled capability as a musician and producer.</h2>    </div> </center><hr>

 <!-- info -->
               <h3> <p><div class="texto-centrado" style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:60px;"> <span style="color:rgb(207, 165, 139);">Min Yoongi (Hangul: 민윤기; born on March 9, 1993), also known as Agust D (as a solo artist) and Suga, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, record producer and member of South Korean boy group BTS (Hangul: 방탄소년단). He debuted as the main rapper of BTS in June 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment (now: BIGHIT MUSIC). <br> Prior to his debut, he was an underground hip-hop rapper under the name "Gloss" that self-wrote and produced his music. Suga adopted the alias Agust D in 2016, which is derived from the initials "DT", short for his birth place "Daegu Town", and "Suga" spelled backwards. <br>

  <br> His first self-produced mixtape, Agust D was released on August 16, 2016 via SoundCloud. He intended to release his music for free in the form of a mixtape instead of a commercial studio album, describing it as the "feeling of being trapped in some sort of framework." On the record, he discussed matters such as his struggles with depression and social phobia. Fuse TV rated it as one of the top twenty mixtapes of 2016. <br>
   
  <br> Suga re-released his mixtape for digital purchase and streaming in February 2018. The success of the reissue placed it at number three on Billboard's World Albums Chart, number five on the Heatseekers Albums Chart, and caused Suga's solo alias, Agust D, to reach number 46 on the Emerging Artists chart for the week of March 3. <br>
   
   <br> In 2020, he released his second solo mixtape D-2 along with the lead single Daechwita on May 22. The mixtape consists of ten tracks, with songs sung and rapped in both Korean and English. Its lyrics share his viewpoint of the contemporary world. D-2 is according to him "a documentation of myself from 2016 onwards". <br>
   
   <br>His debut solo album D-Day was released on April 21, 2023. Featuring the singles People Pt. 2 and Haegum, the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, tying him with teammate Jimin as the highest-charting South Korean solo artists in the history of the chart. <br>
   
   Suga is responsible for writing, composing and arranging, as well as mixing and mastering his material. He has over 150 registered songs accredited to his name with the Korea Music Copyright Association. Including Suran's WINE, which peaked at number two on the Gaon Music Chart and won Best R&B at the 2017 Melon Music Awards.
   The foundation of his lyrics involve themes that are "full of dreams and hope", conceived with the intent of his music becoming "many people's strength". He cites Stony Skunk and Epik High as his inspirations to pursue hip hop music. Particularly, he credits the former's reggae-hip-hop hybrid album Ragga Muffin (2005) and its title track for igniting his interest in the genre, calling it "completely different" from mainstream music. <br>
  <br>Suga started his mandatory military service on the 22nd of September 2023. <br> </span></div></center></h3>
